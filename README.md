# Project-2-CPP
Creates a bank account, calculates balances with and without desposits, and displays a table of values. 

Summarize the project and what problem it solves
In this project, I created a program which allows for the creation of a "bank account", allows for monthly deposits, and displays a table of values to monitor compound interest.

What did you do well?
I was able to produce this project fairly quickly and have the requested features with proper functionality. 

Where could you enhance your code?
I could have taken better use of modularization, as was the purpose of the project. I also did not specify the type of data to input and validate the data type so the program does not function as intended outside of the requested features. 

Which pieces of code did you find most challenging to write and how did you overcome it?
As a beginning programmer, the nested for loops are still a bit tricky to get down. I found that as soon as I understood what I was doing, I would immediately forget the understanding and struggle a bit longer. What helped resolve this was drawing out what I was trying to get the code to do and have a visual understanding. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects?
Any projects which take user input, perform calculations with the input, and output graphical data based on the outputs. This would be very helpful to look back on for Python projects. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
There is simple and understandable comments throughout the project and the formatting is to industry standard allowing for easy readability.
